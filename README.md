Steps I took to complete Blog Preview Card Challenge:

1. Complete replica in Figma: https://www.figma.com/design/FbQAMmLG3AW6w4j9hpgYBY/juan-lab-3-2-b?node-id=1-2&m=dev
2. Export code (had to do manually from Anima plugin because free exports ran out apparently)
3. 


Reflection Questions:

How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?

- IT RUINED EVERYTHING. Jk, it's cool to be able to whip up a prototype so quickly, but I personally found it a nightmare having to
- decode its exported HTML/CSS, especially when I was just beginning to create a system for myself via vanilla CSS.
- This was an important assignment for me though, because it taught me that, without a doubt, UI is not for me.

What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?

- The biggest hurdle, as alluded to above, was trying to figure out what on earth the CSS given to me by Figma was doing.
- So many things were set to "absolute" meaning fixed, but I wasn't sure what pertained to what, so I couldn't hack the last
- part of the assignment, which was to get the design to be responsive to a mobile screen

How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?

- They serve as a decent resource for practicing my web development skills, though as I said I think going forward I will
- bypass using Figma as a personal tool and only use it if I have to (hopefully I don't have to...)
